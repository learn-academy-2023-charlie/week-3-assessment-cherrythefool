# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: 
JSX is a combination of HTML and Javascript which allows similar functionality and syntax of the two to be used together. One syntax difference between JSX and HTML is that JSX uses className instead of class. Another difference in JSX is that you can intersperse JavaScript into your HTML code with the use of {curly brackets}, rather than ${dollar sign and curly brackets}.

Researched answer:
A great tool you can use with JavaScript to help build the visuals of a web page is JSX, which is a JavaScript extension that acts a lot like HTML. It does have some syntax differences from HTML to properly integrate with JavaScript, for example JSX uses className where HTML uses class.

1. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified when you run the command yarn in your terminal?

Your answer:
To use react and jest testing, you need something like Yarn or NPM to allow different aspects of functionality than what you have with just a coding interface. 

Researched answer:
Yarn (yet another resource negotiator) is a package manager, which means it gives us packages and package dependencies to allow different functions. We've been using yarn for Jest testing and JSX packages and dependencies.

3. What is a React component?

Your answer: A React component is a modular section of overall code for the app. React lets you section parts out to make dynamic functionality more seamless and less of a time-sink for the coder.

Researched answer: React is made of components, which are modular reusable sections of code. This gives you seamlessly dynamic functionality.

4. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: State values in React allow you to track changes in a way that the user can see, while props allow you to transfer data between different components of the app.

Researched answer:
State allows you to build dynamic functionality that applies to the component you're working within, while props allow you to pass functionality between components.

5. What is the DOM?

Your answer: DOM is a document object model, which shows the user interface with what html looks like. 

Researched answer:
DOM is a document object model, which shows what the html will look like.

6. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div tag and a span tag?

Your answer: A div tag sets up a division for the page and is a bit different from the span tag.

Researched answer:
Span and div tags can both be used as containers. A div tag helps to group together sections of code, while a span tag allows you to style a section of code differently.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming: Object-oriented programming is focusing programming around objects, the insterseciton of data and behavior. This allows you to work with data in a small part of the code without affecting the whole code.

2. Ruby: Ruby is a programming language! It's heavily object oriented

3. Implicit return: Without writing in return, Ruby will automatically return the value of the last line.

4. Ruby blocks: Ruby blocks are pieces of code which pass functionality to a method to determine the outcome.

5. Ruby hashes: Hashes are collections of unique keys and their values - it's different from an array because it uses the unique key instead of an index to find values.
